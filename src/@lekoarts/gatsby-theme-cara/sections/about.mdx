# About

I am passionate about software craftsmanship and innovation in business.

My master's degree in Software Engineering, my passion, and my experiences helped me to deepen my technical skills in software development best practices (Testing, Clean architecture, CI/CD, Microservices, Agile SDLC, etc.).

And my Master's degree in Marketing, Management, and Communication allowed me to discover the business side (Agile importance, product management, marketing, team management, etc.).

I gain more satisfaction when I am challenged and given the opportunity to learn new things.
