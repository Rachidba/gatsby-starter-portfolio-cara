# About

My master's degree in Software Engineering, my passion, and my experiences helped me to deepen my technical skills in software development best practices (Testing, Clean architecture, CI/CD, Microservices, Agile SDLC, etc.).

And my Master's degree in Marketing, Management, and Communication allowed me to discover the business side (Agile importance, product management, marketing, team management, etc.).

I can participate in different phases of product building: System design, Front/Back-end development, CI/CD pipeline implementation, Code reviews to respect best practices (SRP, KISS, YAGNI, Design patterns, etc.), Deployment, and Team management.

I gain more satisfaction when I am challenged and given the opportunity to learn new things.
